# TMMi Tracker Database Persistence Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented comprehensive database persistence for your N2S TMMi Tracker to ensure data survives server deployments and restarts.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Environment-Based Configuration âœ…
- **Database Path**: Configurable via `TMMI_DB_PATH` environment variable
- **Backup Directory**: Configurable via `TMMI_BACKUP_DIR` environment variable
- **Questions File**: Configurable via `TMMI_QUESTIONS_PATH` environment variable
- **Backward Compatibility**: Defaults to existing paths if env vars not set

### 2. Database Backup & Restore System âœ…
- **Automatic Backups**: Created on application startup
- **Manual Backup**: Through Database Admin interface
- **Restore Functionality**: Restore from any backup file
- **Integrity Checks**: Verify database health before/after operations
- **Statistics**: Monitor database size, record counts, etc.

### 3. Production Deployment Support âœ…
- **Docker Configuration**: `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` with persistent volumes
- **Enhanced Startup Script**: Updated `run_app.sh` with environment support
- **GitHub Actions**: Complete CI/CD workflow with health checks
- **Volume Mounting**: Properly configured persistent storage

### 4. Database Administration Interface âœ…
- **New Admin Page**: Accessible through "Database Admin" in navigation
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time database status and statistics
- **Backup Management**: Create, restore, and clean up backup files
- **Maintenance Tools**: Database vacuum, integrity checks
- **Export Options**: Download database files

### 5. Deployment Documentation âœ…
- **Complete Guide**: `deploy.md` with step-by-step instructions
- **Multiple Scenarios**: Docker, traditional server, GitHub Actions
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
- **Security Considerations**: Best practices for production

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files:
- `src/models/database.py`: Added backup/restore methods and env config
- `app.py`: Added database admin page routing
- `run_app.sh`: Enhanced with environment variables and automatic backups

### New Files:
- `src/components/database_admin.py`: Complete admin interface
- `Dockerfile`: Production-ready container configuration
- `docker-compose.yml`: Service orchestration with persistent volumes
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: CI/CD pipeline with health checks
- `deploy.md`: Comprehensive deployment documentation

## Production Setup

### For Docker Deployment:
```bash
# Simple one-command deployment
docker-compose up -d
```

### For Traditional Server:
```bash
# Set persistent paths
export TMMI_DB_PATH="/var/lib/tmmi/assessments.db"
export TMMI_BACKUP_DIR="/var/lib/tmmi/backups"

# Run application
./run_app.sh
```

### For GitHub Actions:
1. Add repository secrets for server credentials
2. Push to main branch - automatic deployment with health checks
3. Backups created before each deployment

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero Data Loss**: Automatic backups prevent data loss during deployments
2. **Easy Recovery**: One-click restore from backup files
3. **Health Monitoring**: Real-time database status and statistics
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Works with Docker, VMs, or cloud platforms
5. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Automated deployments with health verification

## Environment Variables Summary

```bash
# Required for production persistence
export TMMI_DB_PATH="/path/to/persistent/assessments.db"
export TMMI_BACKUP_DIR="/path/to/persistent/backups"
export TMMI_QUESTIONS_PATH="/path/to/persistent/tmmi_questions.json"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Implementation**:
   - Access "Database Admin" page to verify functionality
   - Create a manual backup to test the system
   - Check database statistics

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Follow `deploy.md` for your specific environment
   - Set appropriate environment variables
   - Configure automated backups (cron job or similar)

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Monitor disk space for database and backups
   - Set up alerts for backup failures
   - Regular health checks via admin interface

## Security Notes

- Database files should be in directories with restricted access
- Backup files contain sensitive assessment data
- Use HTTPS in production
- Consider encryption for backup storage

Your N2S TMMi Tracker is now production-ready with robust data persistence! ðŸš€
